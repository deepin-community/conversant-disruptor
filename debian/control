Description: Very low latency Java BlockingQueue
 Disruptor is the highest performing intra-thread transfer mechanism
 available in Java. Conversant Disruptor is the highest performing
 implementation of this type of ring buffer queue because it has almost
 no overhead and it exploits a particularly simple design.
